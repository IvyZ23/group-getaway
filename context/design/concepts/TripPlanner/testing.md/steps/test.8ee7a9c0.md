# test: LikertSurvey

Please include one test that is operational: A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example. Also include a test case for each of these scenarios:

* Create two trips for the same owner, destination, and dateRange (expect an error for the second).
* Add the same user twice to a trip (expect error thrown)
* Add a user to a trip that doesnâ€™t exist (expect error).
* Non-owner trying to finalize a trip (expect error).

Please split these into separate tests.
