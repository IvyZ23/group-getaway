# test: PasswordAuth

Please include one test that is operational: A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example. Also include a test case for each of these scenarios:

* Creating users with the same username.
* Empty username or password
* White space in password (spaces and such)
* Providing valid username but incorrect password (should fail)

Keep these as separate tests in the same file.
