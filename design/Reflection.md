## What was hard or easy? 

For this project, I found the visual design part easiest and most enjoyable. I liked looking into the different types of fonts and coming up with a vision board for my website. I also enjoyed coding up the frontend portion of it, although linking up the backend and frontend so they work together seamlessly was on the harder side. I found it hard splitting the app into specific concepts because it was so easy to accidentally make one concept reliant on another. Also when coming up with concepts, it was tough keeping it below 5. It was tempting to try and add more functionality to the website, even though it would not have been reasonable in terms of the time constraints we have. I had to think thoroughly about what functionalities I can keep and which ones I have to scrap in order to ensure that I can finish the project on time. 

## What went well? What mistakes did you make, and how would you avoid making them in the future? 

I think the majority of the project went well. Some mistakes I would like to avoid in the future is working on too large of a task at a time. It often felt overwhelming and this way of working made my project more prone to mistakes. In the future, I would make sure to break my tasks down to small bits and test them thoroughly before moving on to the next step. This would ensure I have less bugs that build up and cause trouble down the line.

## What skills did you acquire and which do you feel you still need to develop further?


I developed skills in breaking up an idea in reusable concepts and learned how to use syncs to connect them. I also learned more about visual design and on how different types of fonts and colors might impact the feel of the website. I learned prompt engineering and how writing clear, detailed instructions can allow an LLM to be more productive and lessen mistakes they make.

## How did you use the Context tool? How did you use an agentic coding tool? What conclusions would you draw about the appropriate role of LLMs in software development?

I used the Context tool and LLMs to help me speed up the coding process. I asked them to help me brainstorm and write chunks of code. They were especially helpful in helping me write some test cases for my concepts. I can tell them what I want the test cases to test and they'll help me write them up with appropriate, informative console logs. From the project, I learned that LLMs are better off as a tool to help you code, but not something you want to give full control to. They are prone to making mistakes and when you allow them to write large chunks of code, it is most likely buggy. If you rely on LLMs too much, it would be hard to manually debug when the LLM gets confused and can't fix a problem. I think LLMs are best used for small tasks at a time, such as implementing a small function or test case.
