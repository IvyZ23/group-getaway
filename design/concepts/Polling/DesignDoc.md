Changes I made to the concept:
- Updated the specs for adding and removing poll choices to prevent users from executing these actions after the poll has closed. Once polls are closed, no changes to it should occur. 
- Updated the specs for adding/removing poll choices and closing polls so that it requires the user to be the creator of the poll to be able to do these actions. This would restrict access to certain users and not allow unauthorized changes.
