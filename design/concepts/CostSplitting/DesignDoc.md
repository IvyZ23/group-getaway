Changes I made to the concept:
- Made sure to specify in the spec that expenses and values have to positive, since negative numbers would not make sense in the context of covering expenses for an item
- Added a new option to allow for users to change the total cost of an expense. This would allow them to undo any errors they made when inputting the information. When lowering the cost, it should recalculate if the expense is now covered.
